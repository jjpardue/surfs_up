# Surfs Up 

## Purpose

The purpose of our team's weather analysis was to provide W. Avy & Co. a high level overview of historical temperatures to aid in their decision making for setting up their next venture.

We focused our analysis on the history of the year 2017 and on the island of Oahu. W. Avy & Co would like to find out if their surf and ice creme shop would be sustainable, weather-depending, year around.

_All temps reported are in degrees fahreinheit._

As you can see in our side-by-side comparison of June vs. December temperatures, there are some close calls, yet some differences:
   - The average temperature in June is 74 degrees while it shows three degrees cooler on average in December. 
   - The low for December comes in at 56 degrees compared to the low for June being 64 degrees. Still cool on both fronts (pun intended)   and perhaps a hot chocolate option would be more appropriate on cooler days, no?
   - However, when looking at the overall days each month brings in temps above 74 degrees (75% of the tie in June and December), it's likely that if you were to order any hot chocolate for the "cold" days, you would not order it often.
 
Only a quarter of the days in both December and June brought temps between 69 - 73 degrees respectively - not too shabby. 
The high or maximum temp for both months was impressive at 85 in June and 83 in December. Sounds lovely. 

We would be interested to pull additional analyses on precipitation as well as tourism numbers to go along with the temperatures. Because no matter how palatable the temperature feels, if it's raining and/or tourism is down, nobody will be selling surf lessons or icees on the beach.
